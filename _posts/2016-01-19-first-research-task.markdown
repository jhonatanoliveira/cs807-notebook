title: First Research Task: An Introduction to Meteor.js
layout: post
---
The first research task is going to be *the platform* one.
In *the platform*, our goal is to introduce a reactive web app framework called [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/) (or Meteor for short).
Meteor is a framework that uses javascript as its programming language.
The basic idea of this framework is to use one language throughout the whole app development process.
That is, the server and the client will both be programmed in javascript and they will follow a common ground set of rules to interact smoothly and in a reactive way.
Here, we consider reactive the focus of the framework on the flow of the data and on the propagation of changes (by means of events).

In order to do this introduction, a short paper will be written showing the common steps necessary to create an app using Meteor.
A running example will show how to build a simple *TODO app*.
Moreover, some theoretical discussion and background information will be given.
Finally, we will suggest some practical applications using Meteor to solve computing constrains.
