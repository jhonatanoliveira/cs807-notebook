As mentioned in previous post, we are using [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/) as our development platform.
This is our first research task for the class.
As required, we need to write a short paper describing the platform and giving an introduction to it.
Thus, we just finished a first draft for this short paper, named **Getting Started with Meteor**.
The PDF for this first draft can be found in the following Google Drive link:

Any suggestions, comments and critics on how to improve the draft is welcome.
Next, we will work on a simple presentation to introduce Meteor to our classmates.
