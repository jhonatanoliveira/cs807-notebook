This is the first of a series of posts on *Resource Constrained Computing*. This blog is part of a class project. The class is called CS807 - Interactive Hardware, from the University of Regina, and is being offered this semester, Winter 2016, with professor Dr. Gerhard.

My goal with this blog is to post updates on all my class activities throughout the semester. We will start with 5 research tasks to be presented in class. These research tasks will guide us on subjects from cloud computing to GPU programming. Later, we will build a final project involving all of these subjects together.

My next post will be on my first research task.
Hope you enjoy.
