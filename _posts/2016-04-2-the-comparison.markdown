title: The Comparison

The research task A, C, and D were lumped together in my presentation, since they are all in the same topic: Sum Product networks.
The presentation can be seen [here](https://github.com/jhonatanoliveira/cs807-research-tasks/blob/master/the_paper/material/presentation/presentation_ACD.pdf).

The comparison PDF is also available in the [github repository](https://github.com/jhonatanoliveira/cs807-research-tasks) [here](https://github.com/jhonatanoliveira/cs807-research-tasks/tree/master/the_comparison).
This is the abstract for that paper: Implementing Sum-product networks (SPNs) shows challenges for a resource constrain computing point of view.
This is due to the size and processing requirements of these models.
SPNs are a layer-wise mathematical models for learning and inference with probabilistic graphical model.
Given a SPN, inference is done by propagating up and down in the network.
Here, we propose one possible implementation for SPNs by using GPUs when parallelizing computation on the up and down in the networks.
