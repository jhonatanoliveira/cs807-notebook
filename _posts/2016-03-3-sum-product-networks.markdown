It is done the final draft for the next research task, which is "The Paper" one. In this research task, we are supposed to choose a published paper and do a critic on it.
I found this very interesting topic on probabilistic graphical model and the paper I chose won an award of best paper at the conference where it was published.
The paper is overall well written and the idea is very neat.

Follows the abstract for my critic, and the PDF can also be found [at the class repository](https://github.com/jhonatanoliveira/cs807-research-tasks/blob/master/the_paper/the_paper.pdf).

The paper "Sum-Product Networks: A New Deep Architecture" introduces a new mathematical model for inference and learning, called sum-product networks. The new model is represented as directed acyclic graph with multiple layers, thus the classification as a deep architecture. The authors are clear and concise with their comments. The paper is well written and excels in presenting the considerable big content in the constrain of a limited space.
