title: Changing "The Future / The Past" research task
layout: post
---
After a suggestion from professor Dr. Gerhard, we decided to change the subject of the research task "The Future / The Past".
Instead of Smart Grids, we will research Memcomputing, a recently proposed computer architecture.

Hence, the updated 5 research task subjects are:

* **The paper:** [Sum-Product Networks: A New Deep Architecture](http://spn.cs.washington.edu/pubs.shtml)
* **The platform:** [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/)
* **The problem:** Multiplying algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) - Darwiche, A. (2009). Modeling and Reasoning with Bayesian Networks (1st ed.). Cambridge University Press.
* **The comparison:** Implementing ADDs multiplication in Java using CUDA.
* **The future / The past:** [Memcomputing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4798)

Any further update will be posted here later.
